    <h1>“The History of Computers and the Internet”</h1>
    <p>This article traces the <b>origins</b> and <i>development</i> of computing and the
        <u>global network</u> we call the Internet. It uses historical notes, technical
        references, and short code examples to explain how ideas grew from room-sized machines
        to devices in our pockets. Read the sections below to learn about early machines,
        generational advances, the birth of the <abbr title="World Wide Web">WWW</abbr>, and the
        modern era of ubiquitous computing. <hr>

        <h2>Early Computers</h2>
        <p>The earliest computers were huge machines built in the mid-20th century, often filling entire rooms. They
            used vacuum tubes and later transistors to process information. One of the first well-known computers was
            <abbr title="Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer">ENIAC</abbr>(1945), designed for military
            calculations. These machines were extremely expensive and required a lot of power. Unlike modern computers,
            they could only perform limited tasks and needed manual programming. Still, they laid the foundation for the
            digital revolution that followed.

        <h2>Generations of Computers</h2>
        <p>Computer development is often described in generations. The <em>first generation</em> used
            vacuum tubes; the <em>second</em> used transistors; the <mark>third</mark> introduced
            integrated circuits; and later generations led to microprocessors and personal computers.
            Each step reduced size and cost while improving speed and reliability. Advances in
            component technology changed not only hardware but the nature of software and user
            interaction. Where once programs were <small>batch-run</small> and cryptic, later systems
            supported interactive use, graphical displays, and high-level languages. The generational
            model is a convenient way to describe broad shifts; however, transitions were gradual and
            overlapping in practice.</p>

    <section id="Birth">
        <h2>Birth Of the internet</h2>
        <p>Networking ideas preceded the Internet: researchers experimented with packet switching,
            routing, and remote access in the 1960s and 1970s. ARPANET demonstrated that packet-based
            communication could connect distant machines reliably. Over time, protocols like TCP/IP
            standardized how packets were formed, addressed, and reassembled, creating a robust
            <var>network-of-networks</var>. The <q title="World Wide Web">World Wide Web</q> later
            provided a simple hypertext layer (HTTP and HTML) that made it easy for people to publish
            and link documents. These technologies together turned isolated research networks into
            a global infrastructure used by universities, governments, businesses, and eventually
            billions of individuals.

        <h2>Modern Era</h2>
        <p>Today’s computing landscape is defined by mobility, cloud services, and massive data centers.
            Smartphones put powerful CPUs and sensors into people's pockets, and cloud platforms provide
            on-demand computing at huge scale. Terms such as <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr>,
            <abbr title="Central Processing Unit">CPU</abbr>, and <abbr
                title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr>
            are everywhere, reflecting how technology moved from labs to everyday life. Security, privacy,
            and ethics are now central concerns as systems influence health, elections, and commerce.
            At the same time, new paradigms — machine learning, edge computing, and quantum experiments —
            keep reshaping what is possible. The modern era blends immense opportunity with complex challenges.
