    <h1><u>Exploring The Capital Of India :"DELHI"</u></h1>
    <p>Delhi, the capital city of India, is a historic and culturally rich metropolis that has been the center of power for several ancient and medieval empires. The city is home to iconic landmarks such as the Red Fort, Qutub Minar, and India Gate, reflecting its deep historical significance and architectural grandeur. Old Delhi, with its narrow lanes and bustling markets, gives a glimpse into the city's Mughal past.</p>
    <p>In contrast, New Delhi represents modernity, with wide roads, government buildings, embassies, and contemporary infrastructure. It serves as the political heart of India, housing the President’s residence, Parliament, and the Supreme Court. The city is also a major center for education, business, and media, making it a key player in the nation’s growth.</p>
    <p>Culturally diverse and vibrant, Delhi is known for its festivals, art, music, and especially its food, ranging from street-side chaats to fine dining experiences. People from across India live here, adding to its multicultural identity. Despite facing challenges like pollution and traffic, Delhi continues to thrive as a city of opportunities, history, and resilience.</p>
